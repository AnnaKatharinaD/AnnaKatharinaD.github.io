# Characterizing features and shibboleths in german dialect areas
<!--
## Data
The data comes from the "Phonetischer Atlas
von Deutschland" collected at the research center
"Deutscher Sprachatlas" in Marburg. The corpus
contains phonetic alignments of pronunciations of
185 unique lemmas or concepts collected at 183
sites in Germany. The phonetic transcription is
very detailed, using a total of 3782 different sym-
bols. The concepts used are based on sentences
developed by Georg Wenker in 1880, specifically
to show the differences in german dialects.

## Identifying shibboleths

## Identifying characteristic sound features


The results for all three dimensions align with German dialect features. The most prominent differences between the sites in the first and second dimension correspond to the classification of lower,
middle and high German. The features such as re-
placing [t] with [s] like in ’essen’ corresponds to the
high German consonant shift that affected the south
of Germany the most, while leaving most of north
Germany unaffected. In this way, northern Germany shares similarities with other germanic languages such as English (eat) or Dutch (eten). The low MDS in the north correspond to the lower German dialects that were least affected by the High German Dialect shifts, while the high MDS values in the south correspond to the highly affected areas
(High German).

In the second dimension the low MDS values are separated such that they resembles
the geographical area of Middle German. The main
separating line between high and low values also closely resembles the so called Benrath line and Uerdinger line. These two isoglosses divide the northern dialects from the middle and high German
dialects. The defining feature, [k] -> [x] (’maken’ vs. ’machen’ and ’ik’ vs. ’ich’ for both lines respectively) is prominent in the differing features within
the sites of the second dimension.

The third dimension divides the upper and middle German dialects
into two groups: The western part includes Rhine
and Moselle Franconian as well as hessian dialects,
and even Swabian in the south. There is a sharp
line dividing it from the eastern part at the border to
Bavaria. The eastern part includes Bavarian, Upper
Saxon and Thuringian. Overall, the first dimension
shows the general discrepancy in the effect in the
high german consonant shift between the northern
and southern parts of Germany, the second dimen-
sion shows the distinction between low and middle
german dialects, and the third dimension shows the
east-west split between west and east Upper and
Middle German, namely between the Franconian
dialects and the Bavarian/Saxonian dialects. -->
