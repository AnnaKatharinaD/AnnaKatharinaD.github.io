# A corpus of gender-inclusive language in German (Gil-Galad)

The need for gender-inclusive language has become a highly debated topic over the years: Not too long ago a certain politician made headlines with a call to ban gender-inclusive language in schools and administration in Bavaria.

## German Gender Inclusive Language
Creating gender-neutral language in English is relatively easy: It is a "natural gender" language, so semantic gender only comes up in pronouns or gendered nouns like "brother" and "sister".
In German (and many other languages) things are not so simple: It is grammatically gendered, which means gender is also reflected in other parts of speech, like articles, adjectives and adverbs. One issue that comes up a lot in the discussion is the fact that nouns referring to people (for example job titles) are also traditionally gendered in a masculine way: This "assumed male" gendering has been raising concerns since the 1970s, and lead to a move away from this towards including the feminine forms as well.

Let's look at some different ways we can use GIL in German. We will use the example "Lehrer/Lehrerin" (teacher m./f.): What if we want to refer to a group of teachers of mixed gender?

- The traditional approach would be "die Lehrer" (m.): This form is identical to what we would use for a group of exclusively male teachers, so we could argue that the female teachers are subtly excluded. This is the *generic masculine*.
- We could also go the opposite approach and use "die Lehrerinnen", as a *generic feminine*. Of course, this just inverts the problem, and now the male teachers might feel excluded.

So now we have two options: Do we want to *include* or *abstract*? 

- A very common inclusive form is to just refer to both: "Lehrer und Lehrerinnen". (*double mention*)
- Another alternative is called "*Binnen-I*": We just shorten the form to "LehrerInnen"
- There are different recent forms of this same idea, adding different symbols to also include people who do not identify with either gender: Some examples include Lehrer*innen or Lehrer_innen.

If we go with the abstraction route, we use explicitly gender-neutral rephrasings whenever possible.

- We could use forms of 'person' or 'human' with their occupation as an adjective instead: "Lehrende Personen", "Lehrende Menschen" (teaching people)...
- ...only use nominalized participles or adjectives: "Lehrende" (teaching ones)
- ...or use abstract, inherently genderless nouns: "Lehrkr√§fte" (teaching forces) or "Lehrerschaft" (teaching body)
