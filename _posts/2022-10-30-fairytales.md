# Comparing Fairy- and Folktales across cultures
 - Analysis of keywords, Age/gender bias and violence
 - Are German fairytales more sexist and brutal than others?
 - Link of Gender to Age: age is more likely to be mentioned for women

The words also do not differ significantly in terms of
relative frequency to tales of other cultures. In fact, the West African tales
contain the highest relative frequency of ‘cut’, ‘death’ and ‘dead’. However
it must be remarked that the German fairy tales do seem to often use these
words in more gruesome contexts: Especially when it comes to the words ‘cut’
and ’death’, it is very often used in the context of cutting off body parts and
gruesome death, compared to the usage in the other tales. Based on these results
we can conclude that the German fairy tales do not show a significant difference
when it comes to the raw frequencies of these potentially violent words, but
there seems to be some indication that they are used in more detailed violent
descriptions. On the other hand, the much smaller Japanese corpus also includes
several references to body parts being cut off, the Irish keywords feature the
word ‘corpse’, and the West African corpus has the highest frequency of ‘death’
and ‘dead’.
