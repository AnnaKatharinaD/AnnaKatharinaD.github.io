# Identifying and Categorizing Gender Bias in Movie Descriptions

Have you heard of the Bechdel test? Popularized by Alison Bechdel in 1985, a movie should fulfil 3 simple requirements:
1. It has to have at least two [named] women in it
2. Who talk to each other
3. About something besides a man

Though these requirements seem quite simple, almost half of movies fail this test (https://bechdeltest.com/statistics/).
